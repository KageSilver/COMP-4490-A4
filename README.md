# Assignment 3 - Tara Boulanger (7922331)

### Platform details:
I am running this on a Windows 10 PC with an AMD Ryzen 5 5600X 6-Core Processor with 3.70 GHz and an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 graphics card.

### A+ feature:
No A+ feature has been implemented.

### Other notes:
I used parts of my assignment 3 solution and the tesselation examples provided on UMLearn as a base example for my programs. It also uses example4 as a base for the illumination.

- It would appear as though numbers 7-9 end up producing the same amount of tessellations for my graphics card.
- It looks like the way I'm repopulating the terrain at the end looks a bit janky when you tilt the camera up or down.
- It also appears as though there's something very weird happening with the lighting where if you move it, it hardly moves.
